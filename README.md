### Growth Mindset

Growth Mindset - shouldn't we all want this? To be stagnant or not curious about our day to day lives is boring to me. Without learning you absolutely can not grow. I am not sure I will ever relate to the individuals that just take things as they are, with no research or clarity on what it is they are hearing. Whether it be on the news, social media, and even talks around the family table. Instead of shying away from obstables or challenges, dive into them and see what you can learn. I also believe that you have to have a *growth mindset* not only in a professional environment, but also in our personal lives. I don't believe you can have one or the other. If you make it a habit to live with a *growth mindset* in your personal life, it will become a habit in your professional life as well.

I will continually strive to ***embrace*** challenges, and not let the lack of education hold me back to suceed. By diving in head first I can ***overcome obstacles*** of fear that might keep me from trying or learning something new. I will do my best to ***accept constructive criticism*** from others more knowledegable than me, because knowledge is power right?

I have over 20 years of AP experience using various softwares, but I am now in a Product Support role on the backend of accounting. It has been interesting to me learn more on this end of software development.
I have two sons, a cat, and two dogs that keep me busy most of the time and in my spare time I sing.
