# What is a Text Editor?

A text editor is software that you can either download and install, or you can access online through your web browser. This software allows you to write and edit text in order for you to build a website. This is a key asset for web developers. Technically it doesn't really matter which text editor you use, however according to the Older Coder, there are certian features you should look for in choosing an editor. 

* code completion
* syntax highlighting
* a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)
* the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them

Pick one that you truly enjoy using, there are many to choose from. There is no harm in trying various editors to see which one you like the most. Computers already have preloaded text editing software provided. On Mac, it's called Text Edit and on Windows, it's called Notepad. These are good to have, but to really have more flexibility and code more effieciently, it's recommended to download other editors. 

## What do the following commands do?
* pwd - this stands for Print Working Directory and it outputs the absolute path of the directory you are in
* ls - it allows you to list the contents of the directory you want, including files and other nested directories
* cd - this stands for Change Directory and switches you to the directory you are trying to access
* mkdir - this allows you to create new folders in the shell
* touch - allows you to update the access and modification times of the specified files

## What is IDEs

An IDE (Integrated Development Environment). As your skills grow with coding, an IDE will provide you with a 'All In One' package so to speak. An IDE would include:

*  text editor
*  a file manager
*  a compiler
*  debugger

An IDE might be overwhelming if you are not familiar with text editors, but as you become more familiar and grow in your skillset, you will be able to use an IDE in your every day work. 


## To create a new folder and name the path, here is an example of the commands you would run:
* cd projects
* mkdir new-project
*touch new-project/newfile.md
* cd ..
* ls projects/new-project
